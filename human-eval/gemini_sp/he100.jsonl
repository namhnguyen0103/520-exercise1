{"task_id": "HumanEval/100", "completion": "def make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, this function calculates the number of stones \n    in each of the n levels of a stone pile.\n\n    The rules for the number of stones in each subsequent level are:\n    1. The first level has n stones.\n    2. Subsequent levels increase by 2 (next odd or next even number), \n       maintaining the parity of n.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of levels in the pile (must be a positive integer).\n\n    Returns:\n        list[int]: A list where each element is the number of stones in the \n                   corresponding level, from level 1 to level n.\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    >>> make_a_pile(4)\n    [4, 6, 8, 10]\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Function Definition and Initialization\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the number of stones in each level.\n    pile_stones = []\n\n    # Check if n is a positive integer, although the prompt implies valid input.\n    if n <= 0:\n        # Returning an empty list for non-positive inputs\n        return pile_stones\n\n    # 2. Base Case and Iteration Setup\n    # The first level (Level 1) always has 'n' stones.\n    current_stones = n\n    pile_stones.append(current_stones)\n\n    # The rule is that the next level's stone count must maintain the parity \n    # of 'n' while being the next number of that parity. Since the difference \n    # between consecutive odd numbers is 2, and the difference between \n    # consecutive even numbers is also 2, the number of stones always increases \n    # by 2, regardless of n's initial parity.\n\n    # 3. Iterative Calculation of Subsequent Levels\n    # We need to calculate stones for the remaining n-1 levels (from level 2 to n).\n    # The loop runs for i = 1, 2, ..., n-1 times.\n    for i in range(1, n - 1):\n        # Determine the number of stones for the next level.\n        # Since the parity is already established by 'n', and we always need the \n        # *next* number of that same parity, we simply add 2 to the previous level's count.\n        \n        # Case 1: n is Odd (e.g., 3 -> 5 -> 7)\n        # Case 2: n is Even (e.g., 4 -> 6 -> 8)\n        # In both cases, the increment is +2.\n        next_stones = current_stones + 2\n        \n        # Update the list with the calculated stone count.\n        pile_stones.append(next_stones)\n        \n        # Update the working variable for the next iteration.\n        current_stones = next_stones\n\n    # 4. Return Value\n    return pile_stones"}
