Initial Constraint Validation (Length Check)\n    # A string must have a length of at least 3 to be considered happy.\n    string_length = len(s)\n    if string_length < 3:\n        # If the length is less than 3, it fails the primary condition.\n        return False\n\n    # 2. Iteration Setup (Sliding Window)\n    # We iterate through the string using a sliding window of size 3.\n    # The loop stops at the index i where the triplet (s[i], s[i+1], s[i+2])\n    # is the last possible triplet in the string.\n    # This range is from 0 up to (length - 3). In Python, range(len - 2)\n    # covers indices 0 to len - 3.\n    for i in range(string_length - 2):\n\n        # 3. Consecutive Triplet Check\n        # Extract the current 3 consecutive characters.\n        c1, c2, c3 = s[i], s[i+1], s[i+2]\n\n        # Use a set to efficiently check for distinctness. A set only stores\n        # unique elements. If all three characters are distinct, the set size\n        # will be 3.\n        char_set = {c1, c2, c3}\n\n        # 4. Failure Handling (Early Exit)\n        # If the size of the set is less than 3, it means there is a duplicate\n        # character within the triplet (e.g., 'aa', 'aba', 'xyy').\n        if len(char_set) < 3:\n            # We found a non-happy triplet, so the entire string is not happy.\n            return False\n\n    # 4. Success Handling (Default Return)\n    # If the loop completes without finding any non-happy triplets, it means\n    # every 3 consecutive letters were distinct.\n    return True"}
