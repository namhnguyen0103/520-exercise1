    """
    Determine whether a string is "happy".

    A string is happy iff:
      1) Its length is at least 3, and
      2) For every contiguous triple of characters (s[i], s[i+1], s[i+2]),
         all three characters are pairwise distinct.

    The check is purely by character equality; it works for ASCII and Unicode.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> is_happy("a")
    False
    >>> is_happy("aa")
    False
    >>> is_happy("abcd")
    True
    >>> is_happy("aabb")
    False
    >>> is_happy("adb")
    True
    >>> is_happy("xyy")
    False
    >>> is_happy("abca")  # "abc" and "bca" are both triples of distinct chars
    True
