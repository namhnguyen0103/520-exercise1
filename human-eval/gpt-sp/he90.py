def next_smallest(lst: Iterable[int]) -> Optional[int]:
    """
    Return the second smallest *distinct* integer in `lst`.
    If there is no such element (e.g., list too short or all values equal), return None.

    The function does not mutate `lst` and operates in a single pass with O(1) extra space.

    Definitions:
    - Let `m1` be the smallest distinct value.
    - Let `m2` be the smallest distinct value strictly greater than `m1`.
    - Return `m2` if it exists; else return None.

    Examples:
    >>> next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    2
    >>> next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2])
    2
    >>> next_smallest([])
    >>> next_smallest([1, 1])
    >>> next_smallest([2, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> next_smallest([-1, -5, -5, -2])
    -2

    Complexity:
    - Time: O(n) for n = len(lst), single pass
    - Space: O(1) auxiliary
