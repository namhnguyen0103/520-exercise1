// First Prompt
You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to write a solution for the following function:

def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''

First, generate a comprehensive, step-by-step technical plan for this function. DO NOT write any code yet, only the plan

// Second Prompt
Using the plan you just created, write the complete and production-ready Python code. Implement all the steps outlined in your plan, including detailed comments.
