Input Validation/Edge Cases: If the list has fewer than 3 elements, \n    # a triplet cannot be formed.\n    if len(l) < 3:\n        return False\n\n    # 2. Sorting: Sort the list.

Main Loop Initialization: Iterate through the list, fixing the first element (l[i]).\n    # We only need to iterate up to N - 2, as we need at least two elements remaining \n    # for the 'left' and 'right' pointers.\n    for i in range(N - 2):\n        # Calculate the required target sum for the remaining two elements: target = 0 - l[i].\n        target = 0 - l[i]\n\n        # 4.

Inner Search Loop: Perform the two-pointer search on the remaining subarray.\n        # Continues as long as the pointers have not crossed.\n        while left < right:\n            # 6. Sum Calculation and Decision:\n            current_sum = l[left] + l[right]\n\n            # Case A (Target Found): If the sum of the two pointers equals the target,\n            # we have found a triplet that sums to zero.\n            if current_sum == target:\n                return True\n\n            # Case B (Sum Too Small): If the sum is less than the target, we need \n            # a larger sum. Move the 'left' pointer to a larger value.\n            elif current_sum < target:\n                left += 1\n\n            # Case C (Sum Too Large): If the sum is greater than the target, we need\n            # a smaller sum. Move the 'right' pointer to a smaller value.\n            else: # current_sum > target\n                right -= 1\n\n    # Phase 3: Final Outcome\n\n    # 7.
