def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list) -> bool:
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    It returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    This function uses the sorted Two-Pointer technique for an efficient O(N^2) time complexity.

    # Phase 1: Pre-processing and Edge Cases

    # 1. Input Validation/Edge Cases: If the list has fewer than 3 elements, 
    # a triplet cannot be formed.
    if len(l) < 3:
        return False

    # 2. Sorting: Sort the list. This step is O(N log N) and is crucial 
    # for the O(N) efficiency of the subsequent Two-Pointer search.
    l.sort()

    N = len(l)

    # Phase 2: Core Logic (O(N^2) Two-Pointer Search)

    # 3. Main Loop Initialization: Iterate through the list, fixing the first element (l[i]).
    # We only need to iterate up to N - 2, as we need at least two elements remaining 
    # for the 'left' and 'right' pointers.
    for i in range(N - 2):
        # Calculate the required target sum for the remaining two elements: target = 0 - l[i].
        target = 0 - l[i]

        # 4. Two-Pointer Setup (Inside the Main Loop):
        # 'left' starts immediately after 'i'.
        left = i + 1
        # 'right' starts at the end of the list.
        right = N - 1

        # 5. Inner Search Loop: Perform the two-pointer search on the remaining subarray.
        # Continues as long as the pointers have not crossed.
        while left < right:
            # 6. Sum Calculation and Decision:
            current_sum = l[left] + l[right]

            # Case A (Target Found): If the sum of the two pointers equals the target,
            # we have found a triplet that sums to zero.
            if current_sum == target:
                return True

            # Case B (Sum Too Small): If the sum is less than the target, we need 
            # a larger sum. Move the 'left' pointer to a larger value.
            elif current_sum < target:
                left += 1

            # Case C (Sum Too Large): If the sum is greater than the target, we need
            # a smaller sum. Move the 'right' pointer to a smaller value.
            else: # current_sum > target
                right -= 1

    # Phase 3: Final Outcome

    # 7. Exhaustive Search Conclusion: If the outer loop completes without
    # finding any triplet, return False.
    return False
