// First Prompt
You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to write a solution for the following function:

def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """

First, generate a comprehensive, step-by-step technical plan for this function. DO NOT write any code yet, only the plan

// Second Prompt
Using the plan you just created, write the complete and production-ready Python code. Implement all the steps outlined in your plan, including detailed comments.
