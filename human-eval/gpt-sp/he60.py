def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """
    sum_to_n is a function that returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

    The function uses the arithmetic series formula n*(n+1)/2 for O(1) computation time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        A non-negative integer representing the upper bound of the sum.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive). Returns 0 if n == 0.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If n is not an integer (or if itâ€™s a boolean).
    ValueError
        If n is negative.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    >>> sum_to_n(0)
    0
