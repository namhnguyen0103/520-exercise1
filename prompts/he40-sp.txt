// First Prompt
You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to write a solution for the decode_shift function:

def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    """

First, generate a comprehensive, step-by-step technical plan for this function. DO NOT write any code yet, only the plan

// Second Prompt
Using the plan you just created, write the complete and production-ready Python code. Implement all the steps outlined in your plan, including detailed comments.
