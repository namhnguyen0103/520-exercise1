// First Prompt
You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to write a solution for the problem:

def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    """

First, generate a comprehensive, step-by-step technical plan for this function. DO NOT write any code yet, only the plan

// Second Prompt
Using the plan you just created, write the complete and production-ready Python code. Implement all the steps outlined in your plan, including detailed comments.
